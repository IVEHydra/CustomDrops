# Introduction

**CustomDrops** is a plugin for **SpigotMC** that Manages Drops and EXP of Blocks, Entities, Fishing and PiglinBartering.

# Why was it abandoned?

This plugin has been abandoned, as I'm working on new projects that will give the ability to do many more things, such as handle drops.
